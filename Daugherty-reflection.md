###What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with the fetch, pull, push commands and what origin meant. I was executing the commands on my own, but wasn't exactly sure what I was doing!

###What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
We work on our own feature branches locally to isolate our changes to we don't break the master. You can type git "command" --help and it will pull up all the functions of that command. Origin meants whatever you have editing control over - it is your code. This could have been forked from another code to be used and changed by you alone. You can track the original copy you forked for your origin by creating a new branch and then fetching often to check for changes. Git pull will both fetch and merge, while git fetch just grabs the work, but doesn't merge automatically - this is a bit safer if you suspect something might overwrite your work.

###What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
My guide and I had a conversation about git pull vs git fetch/git merge because I was unclear on the difference. We also discussed what origin meant - now I understand it is not the master copy everyone works off of, it is the forked copy OF the master that I created, which I have editing priveleges over.

###What still confuses you about git?
I need more practice fetching changes from the origin copy, since I've mostly been pushing changes to it during the challenges.

###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I did not have a pair for this session. My guide acted as a pair and navigated for me as I executed the commands. However, I didn't explain my thinking or elicit feedback as much as I normally would have with a pair.
